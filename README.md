# -15MinuteCity---Bouilouta-
This project consists of assessing Calgary’s 15 minute city status. 

The purpose of this study was to examine the state of the city’s sustainability as it relates to the 15 minute city urban planning method which proposes urban structures which allow residents to access essential facilities within a 15 minute walk. 

For the purposes of this study, essential facilities refer to schools, pharmacies, grocery stores and train stations. 

To conduct this research, data was compiled from the city of Calgary’s open source data. Data sets for vaccination facilities (pharmacies), schools and train stations were collected from there. The grocery store dataset was collected independently using Google Earth Pro to compile coordinates for areas of interest. 

Uploaded into the repository are files extracted from ArcGIS Pro post service area analysis (File Names: Service area_pharma, Service area_schools, Service area_trains, Service area_grocery). 

Also included are maps created following analysis in order to visualize the service areas for each of the essential facilities (File Names: Grocery_Map, Schools_Map, Pharma_Map, Trains_Map, ServiceAreas_Map, FacilityHotspot_Map).
